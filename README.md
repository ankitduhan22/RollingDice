This is a dice game which i have made using HTML,CSS and Javascript. 
This game need 2 players to play, each one have to roll the dice, 
whoever get to score 100 points first will be shown as winner. 
In Javascript file i have used functions, eventlistener , queryselector ,classlist properties like adding removing classes.
